# DataCamp Instructor Onboarding

As the number of instructors creating courses for DataCamp increases,
we need to ensure that they understand how to make courses effective.
The onboarding described here achieves that
subject to the three constraints that:

1.  We cannot require more than an hour of work from first-time instructors
    above and beyond what they would do anyway for their first course.
2.  Both we and new instructors must believe that this training
    reduces time to delivery and increases course quality.
    (It's not enough for this to be trueâ€“it has to be obvious.)
3.  Training has to be optional during the pilot phase,
    i.e.,
    new instructors must be able to build their course
    without taking part.

Onboarding has two phases:

1. *Before You Write Your Spec*:
   A quick introduction to practical findings in learning science
   and how they apply to building asynchronous online courses.
2. *Before You Implement Your Course*:
   the mechanics of building a course
   and what happens during and after delivery.

Please note that this training focuses on building desktop courses.
If it proves successful,
we will expand the training to cover other modes.

## Part 1: Before You Write Your Spec

After instructors have signed a contract,
we will recommend that they watch five short screencasts
(total running time ~45 minutes)
and do five short exercises.
Three of these exercises feed directly into their course spec;
the other two will help us get to know them,
and help them get to know some of their fellow instructors
(which will in turn help us build an instructor community).

After completing these steps,
instructors will be invited to take part in an hour-long online discussion with 3-4 other new instructors
and the head of instructor training.
(In future we may also invite CLs, CDs, and returning instructors to take part,
again as a way to foster growth of an instructor community.)
This session will discuss the instructors' exercises and answer any questions they have about the spec-writing process.

## Part 2: Before You Implement Your Course

Once new instructors have written their spec,
they will be invited to review another series of short screencasts
and then take part in another hour-long online session,
both of which will introduce them to our authoring tools
and explain the course release process.
Repeat instructors will be encouraged to join these sessions as well
in case any of the mechanics of authoring courses have changed
since their last encounter with us.

## Part 3: Assessment

1.  30 days after they complete their course spec,
    each new instructor will be sent a short survey to tell us which parts of this training they found useful,
    which should be amended or dropped,
    and what gaps need to be filled.
    We will administer a similar survey 30 days after they complete the first version of their course
    to assess the value of Part 2 of the onboarding.
2.  During the trial period,
    we will ask CDs how instructors who have had this training compare to instructors who haven't.
3.  We will quantify the training's impact by comparing how long it takes instructors who have had this training
    to complete their specs and develop their courses
    with historical and concurrent times for instructors who haven't done the training.

## Appendix A: Homework for First Online Session

1.  What concepts in your course do you think will be hardest to understand or justify?
2.  Create a multiple-choice question for a topic in your course
    and explain the misconceptions it is meant to diagnose.
3.  Create a short coding exercise that requires learners to debug a few lines of code.
4.  Create a point-form list of key concepts and relationships your course will cover.
    (This is a textual replacement for a concept map.)
5.  In a few bullet points, summarize what you hope to get out of creating a course for DataCamp.
