# general

- we need to motivate this material more
- many instructors will see teaching as a "side gig"
- how will becoming a better teacher help them in their day job?
- e.g. understanding how people learn will help you give more effective presentations, make more compelling arguments to colleagues, etc.

## 166: diagnose and correct misconceptions

how does this apply in datacamp context? carefully considered feedback messages? multiple choice? keep in mind we typically write SCTs, though over time we may wish to have instructors write them

## 210: final exam

what does this mean in datacamp context?

# memory.html

## 114: learning episode

datacamp translation?

## 151: quizzes and flash cards

datacamp implications?

## 173: parsons problems

we mention these but don't yet support on datacamp - is there another example that's more relevant given current exercise types?

## 36: hard to do with auto-grading

suggestions? (maybe you'll get to this)

## 99: independent validation

don't understand the example given ("sure enough...")

## 152: mix text with graphics

in the videos? exercises?

## 60: course-design

duplicate personas?

## 93: activities

should we have them use 2-4 bullets, with each mimicking an instruction?

also for the deliverable, how about 1-2 exercises per chapter (4-5 chapters)? I thought that's what we went with for the specs

## sequencing

can we make the deliverable format more concrete and relevant to datacamp? i.e. chapters, lessons, concepts, etc. w/ numbers based on new content guidelines

## description

I like telling instructors the 1-paragraph description is more of a sales pitch to students since it forces them to think about how to motivate the material instead of just describing/summarizing it

Let's give a range for number of learning objectives. e.g. 4-6?

Should also make it clear prereqs are specific datacamp courses

Also, worth mentioning that this will be completed with help from CL?
