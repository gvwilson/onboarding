# general

- we need to motivate this material more
- many instructors will see teaching as a "side gig"
- how will becoming a better teacher help them in their day job?
- e.g. understanding how people learn will help you give more effective presentations, make more compelling arguments to colleagues, etc.
- what part of this will be pre-reading (I suggest the the theory so the in-person session focuses on application in datacamp setting)
- suggest we focus on courses only (no projects) for v1
- should think about relationship between /authoring and this material. Seems some of this belongs in the official docs. The more duplication, the more we need to be careful to keep things in sync

# novice.html

## 166: diagnose and correct misconceptions

how does this apply in datacamp context? carefully considered feedback messages? multiple choice? keep in mind we typically write SCTs, though over time we may wish to have instructors write them

## 210: final exam

what does this mean in datacamp context?

# memory.html

## 114: learning episode

datacamp translation?

## 151: quizzes and flash cards

datacamp implications?

## 173: parsons problems

we mention these but don't yet support on datacamp - is there another example that's more relevant given current exercise types?

# motivation.html

## 36: hard to do with auto-grading

suggestions? (maybe you'll get to this)

## 99: independent validation

don't understand the example given ("sure enough...")

## 152: mix text with graphics

in the videos? exercises?

## 93: activities

should we have them use 2-4 bullets, with each mimicking an instruction?

also for the deliverable, how about 1-2 exercises per chapter (4-5 chapters)? I thought that's what we went with for the specs

## sequencing

can we make the deliverable format more concrete and relevant to datacamp? i.e. chapters, lessons, concepts, etc. w/ numbers based on new content guidelines

## description

I like telling instructors the 1-paragraph description is more of a sales pitch to students since it forces them to think about how to motivate the material instead of just describing/summarizing it

Let's give a range for number of learning objectives. e.g. 4-6?

Should also make it clear prereqs are specific datacamp courses

Also, worth mentioning that this will be completed with help from CL?

# course-exercises.html

suggest using "exercise" instead of "question" to get them acclimated to our vocabulary

## multiple choice question

"responses" --> "choices"

mention that each answer ideally represents a different (incorrect) mental model? (yes, I learned something in carpentry training :))

## write and run

should we use the actual exercise types here? i.e. "normal exercises" so they begin to familiarize themselves with what's available? or will this be covered later?

"starter code" --> "sample code"?

## minimal changes

use more data science-y examples

## finding bugs and tracing execution

possible to use data science examples here (or just cut)?

# course-build

too ambitious to cover this all up front? Maybe we should split off into a second onboarding session after specs are complete (so knowledge is fresh). Regardless, instructors will need some cursory knowledge of different exercise types, auto-grading constraints, etc. to create effective course specs. Let's discuss

## architecture

"sample solution" --> "solution code" to avoid confusing "sample code" and "solution code"

## creating the course-build

normally we do this for instructors

## build process

Maybe better to focus on workflow here - something like "the master branch should always contain a working version of the course...you will work from a separate branch and create PRs for review"

## chapters and exercises

need to update according to new authoring syntax

## typical exercise

same as above

## note on languages

some of this should probably make it into the official authoring docs at /authoring

## course structure, etc.

TODO: nick to review when back online - hard to view in html

# course editor

vision here? how much do we want to get into this given the product will change? maybe better to create short screencasts for just-in-time docs?
