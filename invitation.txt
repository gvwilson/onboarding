Hi ____,

Thanks again for agreeing to build a course for DataCamp.  To help you
get rolling, we've created a short tutorial on best practices in
course development and how they apply to our platform and learners.
The tutorial consists of a set of five brief screencasts you can watch
on your own time and an hour-long discussion session.  Participation
isn't mandatory, but people who have taken the training I developed
for Software Carpentry found it interesting as well as useful, and it
will help you get your course spec written in less time and with less
fuss.

The next discussion session is on Wednesday, January 17 - if you would
like to take part, please let me know what times during the day would
work best for you by filling in http://whenisgood.net/dkxayng, and
we'll try to find a slot that fits everyone's schedule.  (If you can't
make that day, there will be another session the following week.)

Thanks in advance,
Greg Wilson
