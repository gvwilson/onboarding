Hi,

Thanks for chatting - I'm looking forward to working with you.  We are now offering a short tutorial on best practices in course development that we think will help you build your course in less time and with less fuss, and will also be useful with other kinds of presentations and teaching.  The tutorial consists of five screencasts to watch on your own time, four short exercises, and an hour-long online discussion to tie it all together; the screencasts are at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjgj6kdf_snbkYNV2Q0Xzkv-DH7bedJIr, and their total running time is about 45 minutes.  If you'd like to dive into that, you can have a browse of the documentation at http://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/, and start thinking about answers to the questions given at the end of the onboarding videos. Our next discussion session will be the week of [DATE], and I'll send you an invite as soon as we've got some possible dates and times lined up.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please get in touch - otherwise, I look forward to seeing you online soon.

Thanks,
Greg Wilson
