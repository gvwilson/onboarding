Hi ____,

Thanks again for agreeing to build a course for DataCamp.  To help you
get rolling, we are now offering a short tutorial on best practices in
course development and how they apply to our platform and learners.
The tutorial consists of a set of five brief screencasts you can watch
on your own time, a few brief exercises, and an hour-long discussion
session to tie it all together.  Participation isn't mandatory, but
people who have taken the Software Carpentry instructor training this
is derived from found it interesting as well as useful, and it will
help you get your course spec written in less time and with less fuss.

The first discussion session will be on Wednesday, January 17. If you
would like to take part, please let me know when during the day would
work best for you by filling in http://whenisgood.net/dkxayng, and
we'll try to find a slot that fits everyone's schedule.  If you can't
make that day, there will be another session in the following week and
more thereafter, and we will schedule them to accommodate you.

Since this is a new adventure for us, we would like to record the
first session for internal use. The recording will only be shared with
DataCamp staff, and will only be used to help us improve the training.
If you would rather not be recorded for any reason, you are very
welcome to opt for the second week's session or a later one (which
won't be recorded).

If you have any questions or suggestions, please get in touch -
otherwise, I look forward to seeing you online soon.

Thanks,
Greg Wilson
