<section>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Even with good will on all sides, things will go wrong</li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Some problems come up more often than others,
      so we have advice on how to avoid them
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">And a process for addressing them when they haven't been avoided</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>The Audience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">You know your content</li>
    <li class="fragment">We know our audience</li>
    <li class="fragment">If we say that an approach isn't going to work for our users, trust us
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">We won't try to make extra work for anyone</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Too Much Math</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">We want to teach people how to use code to apply math to real-world problems</li>
    <li class="fragment">Deriving equations and proving theorems is out of scope
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">And not a fit for our platform</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">This <em>isn't</em> dumbing things down</li>
    <li class="fragment">It's providing an on-ramp to as wide an audience as possible
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Soup, then hymns</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Preaching to Believers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Our users already believe that data science is fun</li>
    <li class="fragment">They already know it's changing the world</li>
    <li class="fragment">So you don't need to tell them this</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Teasers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Don't say "it's really important to think about X"
    <li class="fragment">Their response will (rightly) be, "Think <em>what</em> about X?"</li>
    <li class="fragment">Similarly, "Make this web site more webbish, but not too webbish" never helped anyone
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">If you can't provide rules, provide examples</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Writer's Block</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">The first page is the hardest
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Except for the second</li>
        <li class="fragment">And the thirdâ€¦</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Our <a href="./course-design.html">course design process</a>
      is meant to get you past the worst of this
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">When in doubt, talk to your CL</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h3>Procrastination</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">We can't write the course for you</li>
    <li class="fragment">Weekly check-ins are meant to keep you moving</li>
    <li class="fragment">
      If it becomes clear that content is never going to materialize,
      it's better to part ways amicably than drag things out
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Perfectionism</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">No course will ever be right for everyone</li>
    <li class="fragment">We will provide guidance and feedback as you work
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">Pace and clarity</li>
        <li class="fragment">Voice and grammar</li>
        <li class="fragment">How engaging examples are</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">Soft launch <em>always</em> catches things that authors and CDs didn't expect
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">"No lesson survives first contact with the real world intact."</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Platform Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">We're constantly trying to improve our tools</li>
    <li class="fragment">Which means that occasionally things don't work as we'd like</li>
    <li class="fragment"><em>Please tell us</em> when anything seems off
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">If it's a bug, we'll fix it</li>
        <li class="fragment">If we can improve the user experience for instructors, we'll add it to our backlog</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
