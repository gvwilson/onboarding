  <h3>1. Multiple Choice Question</h3>
  <p>
    Create a multiple-choice question that tests understanding of one
    of the concepts you intend to cover in your course.  Include the
    correct answer and 2-3 incorrect answers, along with an
    explanation of the misconception each incorrect answer is intended
    to diagnose.

  <h3>2. Concept Map</h3>
  <p>
    Create a concept map for one of the core concepts you intend to
    cover in your course. (You can use your favorite digital tool, or
    draw it freehand and take a picture.) Remember to keep it small,
    and to label the connections between the concepts.

  <h3>3. Debugging Exercise</h3>
  <p>
    Write a brief description of a debugging problem you might have
    learners solve during your course.  Include a description of what
    the code is supposed to do, and 5-10 lines of code
    that <em>almost</em> do that.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Inessential Weirdness</h3>
  <p>
    Think about the language features and libraries your learners will
    use, and the terminology they will encounter.  What do you think
    will be most confusing or hardest to justify?  (For example, it's
    often hard to explain to newcomers why Python has both lists and
    tuples.)
