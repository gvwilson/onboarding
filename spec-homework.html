<section>
  <h3>1. Stumbling Blocks</h3>
  <p>
    Think about the language features and libraries your learners will
    use, and the terminology they will encounter.  What do you think
    will be most confusing or hardest to justify?  (For example, it's
    often hard to explain to newcomers why Python has both lists and
    tuples.)
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>2. Multiple Choice Question</h3>
  <p>
    Create a multiple-choice question that tests understanding of one
    of the concepts you intend to cover in your course.  Include the
    correct answer and 2-3 incorrect answers, and explain what
    misconception each incorrect answer is intended to diagnose.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>3. Debugging Exercise</h3>
  <p>
    Write a brief description of a debugging exercise you might have
    learners do in your course.  Include 2-3 sentences explaining what
    the code is supposed to do and 5-10 lines of code that
    <em>almost</em> do that.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>4. Concepts</h3>
  <p>
    Create a point-form list of the concepts and relationships used in
    the debugging exercise you just created.  (This is a textual
    equivalent of a concept map.)
  </p>

  <h3>5. Personal Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    Create a point-form summary of what you hope to get out of
    developing a course for DataCamp.
