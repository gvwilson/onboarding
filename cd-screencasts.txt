Short Screencasts to Introduce Content Development Topics

(and what does it say that I wrote "convent development" twice?)

Each screencast is meant to be less than a minute long.

- How to log in to Teach
  + Because the link is hidden down in the bottom with an obscure name
- What's where in a course home page (just to orient people)
  + Branch tabs
  - Home "tab"
  - Build "tab"
  - Settings "tab"
  - "Build Manually" button
  - "Refresh" link
  + "Edit" button (end with this to segue into the next video)
- What's where in the course editor
  + Overview pane
  + Edit
  - Preview pane
  + Save and sync with GitHub
  - Mode control (to switch between course editing, slide editing, etc.)
  - Assets
    - Show how to do on Teach
    - Show how to do on GitHub: they appear in Teach, but you have to do a manual build to get them in the assets window
+ How to get back to the course's page from the Teach editor
+ How to add an exercise using the menu
  + Also show how to save work at this point
  + And mention the "sync with GitHub" option
- How to add an exercise manually
  - We have to cover copying and pasting Markdown because the current Teach editor doesn't support all exercise types
  - Where do authors find blank Markdown templates for exercise types?
- How to edit an exercise
- How to preview an exercise
+ How to add a new chapter
- How to view uploaded assets
- How to upload an asset

  - Creating branches (and what those look like in Teach)
  - Sync'ing with GitHub in Teach
- How (and why) to build the course manually
- What's in a build log
- Settings: building changed chapters vs. building the whole course
- How to add an image into a slide: click on the asset link, copy that into the slide with Markdown syntax
