Each screencasts is meant to be less than a minute long.

  - Settings "tab"
  - "Build Manually" button
  - "Refresh" link
  - "Edit" button (end with this to segue into the next video)

  - Overview pane
  - Edit/Preview pane
  - Save
  - Sync with GitHub
  - Mode control (to switch between course editing, slide editing, etc.)
