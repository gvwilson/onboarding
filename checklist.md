# Instructor Onboarding Checklist

## Key

- Main (numbered) points are instructor actions
- Sub-points are DataCamp actions.
- *Italics identify parts that have not yet been implemented.*
- CL: Curriculum Lead
- IT: Instructor Trainer

## Process

1. Instructor passes audition.
   - CL informs lead that instructor onboarding exists.
2. Instructor signs contract.
   - CL tells IT to add instructor to queue for invitation to onboarding.
   - IT sends invite to queued instructor with pointers to course design training materials and calendar of upcoming sessions.
3. Instructor chooses timeslot for onboarding session devoted to spec writing, goes through training materials, and does homework exercises.
4. Instructor takes part in online discussion session of spec writing process.
   - IT adds notes to running summary.
5. Instructor writes first full draft of spec.
   - *CL notifies IT that instructor is nearing completion of spec.*
   - *IT sends pointers to Teach Editor training materials and calendar of upcoming sessions.*
6. *Instructor chooses timeslot for onboarding session devoted to the Teach editor, goes through training materials, and does homework exercises.*
7. *Instructor takes part in online demo/Q&A session of Teach editor.*
   - *IT adds notes to running summary.*
6. Instructor finishes spec.

  - *IT sends follow-up survey about onboarding.*

## Notes

- First part of onboarding (for writing specs) is mandatory for first-timers and optional for repeat instructors.
  - Repeat instructors are offered onboarding because it may not have existed when they built their first course.
- Second part of onboarding (Teach editor) is offered to both as well.
